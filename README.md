# The Sample Call Script Project

Whether you're anxious, unsure of what to say, or just want to feel like you're not alone in making these calls, the Sample Call Script Project is for you.

## What is it?

This site is a project intended to host call scripts for persons who wish to contact their elected representatives and other relevant parties within the government. This site is for everyone from leftists to progressives to ordinary Democrats to Republicans of conscience. Interesting times make interesting partners and we're in this together. Some calls will have multiple scripts which may fit your style better.

Email and write letters if you can, but lots of ex-staffers say the call is the next best thing to an in-person visit.

## What scripts are available?

It's primarily based on issues I've heard about, issues I care about, and what I'm able to write. I'm doing my best, but if you want to suggest something...I'm working on implementing that feature.

## How do I know who to call?

You should have 1 Representative and 2 Senators. Some issues will appear before the House, some before the Senate, some before House and Senate subcommittees (in which case I'll include appropriate information although you may also wish to call your own folks with your opinions).

You can find your representative [on the House of Representatives Search Portal](http://www.house.gov/representatives/find/) by entering your zipcode and should be able to get a phone number.

You can find our senators [on the Senate website](https://www.senate.gov/senators/contact/) by using your state's dropdown or searching. Both your state senators represent you.

**Tip!** Put their contact information in your cell phone. I have contact information for local offices AND DC offices in my cell phone right now. It makes calling one step faster.

Once there's a full and reliable place to get all the names of those just sworn in and their contact information, I'll add that too or create my own.

## Isn't this overwhelming?

It can be. I certainly find it so some days, or even some hours of every day. Not every call is going to stop your elected official (most may not), nor is calling all we are going to have to do.

You don't have to call every day. Focus on the things you care most about and prioritize those for calls. Call about them _and_ find ways to engage in your community. Drink water before and after calling (really! it'll help you talk).

Consider sending a brief email about things which you value less but still care about.

## What if I don't like your script?

That's fine! Not every script is going to be a good fit for everyone and you don't have to follow a script to the letter. Rewrite it, come up with another, throw yours in pastebin or a Google doc and share it with your friends! When I have the suggestions up, feel free to pass it along to me to be included.

## Who's writing these scripts anyway?

Someone raised in the Republican party who happened to reread the Gospels while watching bombs fall on Baghdad and took a sharp turn Left past the Democrats into friendly company with the socialists, although I'm more Christocentric than Marxist and appreciate many religions and denominations who work for justice and good in the world (as well as the friendly atheists doing good!). So, someone who's been all over the political landscape. Not Libertarian, but I did marry one. However, he ended up right over here with me by being the kind, decent man I knew he was when I married him.

I've done a fair amount of hobby writing, both non-fiction and fiction. I mostly understand and can at times emphathize with the other side(s) of the aisle (although I disagree on most points and would love for the Christians over there to reread the Bible through the lens of Jesus's teachings and consider Paul as secondary interpretation and join me!). I really, truly do not understand some of the party's current moves, such as not caring about Russian interference in the election. That one befuddles me as much as most people who grew up in the Party of Reagan but departed in the Bush II years.
